## Foundation Planning Session

**Time:** 01:00–01:15 CST  
**Participants:** Igor + Kiki

### What Happened

Igor initiated **Foundation** (Task #1): OpenClaw Lean Operation Setup. Goal = 97% cost reduction via token discipline.

### Key Decisions

1. **Tracking:** Workspace-native (`PROJECTS.md`), NOT Notion
   - Reason: Speed, zero external deps, git-backed, native OpenClaw access
   
2. **4-Phase Rollout:**
   - Phase 1: Foundation Hardening (this week) → 80% cost cut
   - Phase 2: Agent Factory (next week) → SOUL templates + bindings wizard
   - Phase 3: Sub-Agent Orchestration (week 3) → workflow templates
   - Phase 4: Monitoring (week 4) → dashboard + alerts

3. **Phase 1 Priorities (THIS WEEK):**
   - Session init rule → `AGENTS.md`
   - Install Ollama → route heartbeats to local LLM
   - Model routing → Haiku primary, fallbacks to Sonnet/Opus
   - Compress workspace files → trim bloat
   - Token audit setup → 3x calibration cycle

### Research Completed

- Reviewed OpenClaw docs: multi-agent routing, system prompt, sub-agents, agent workspace
- Analyzed 2 YouTube videos on 97% cost reduction strategies (Matt Ganzac)
- Key insights:
  - Context bloat = #1 cost driver (full session history + workspace files on every turn)
  - Ollama heartbeats = zero idle burn
  - Model routing (Haiku → Sonnet → Opus) = 95% task savings
  - Session init rule = 80% context overhead reduction

### Next Steps

1. **Igor:** Review `PROJECTS.md` tracker
2. **Kiki:** Start Phase 1.1 (Session Init Rule) on Igor's signal
3. **Kiki:** Update `memory/2026-02-16.md` at EOD with progress

### Blockers

None yet.

### Notes

- Igor's vibe: Fast, decisive, zero-waste. Matches perfectly with Foundation objectives.
- Tracking system designed for speed — no external tools, all workspace-native.
- Expected Phase 1 completion: <1 hour of work.

## Remote Monitoring Stack Deployment

**Time:** 01:15–01:25 CST  
**Context:** Igor will be away from computer, needs remote visibility into Foundation progress.

### What We Built

**Option 4: Hybrid Stack (Full Control Mode)**

1. **Telegram Status Updates** (LIVE)
   - Auto-notifications on task completion, blockers, phase milestones
   - On-demand "status" → instant PROJECTS.md snapshot
   - Token cost reports for tasks >$1
   - Updated AGENTS.md with notification rules

2. **GitHub Issue Tracking** (Setup script ready)
   - Private repo: `openclaw-foundation`
   - Issue #1 = Foundation tracker with full PROJECTS.md
   - Auto-sync: task completions + blockers → GitHub comments
   - Mobile app notifications
   - Script: `.github-setup.sh`

3. **Tailscale + Web UI** (Setup script ready)
   - Remote access to OpenClaw dashboard from any device
   - Sessions, token graphs, logs in real-time
   - Access via: `http://<tailnet-host>:18789`
   - Script: `.tailscale-setup.sh`

4. **Daily Progress Summary** (Cron script ready)
   - 8 PM CST automated Telegram update
   - Foundation status: completed tasks, blockers, next steps, completion %
   - Script: `.setup-daily-summary.sh`

### Key Decisions

- **Hybrid stack** chosen over simpler options for maximum visibility
- All setup scripts committed to workspace repo
- Telegram = primary notification channel (already configured)
- GitHub = detailed tracking + mobile UI
- Tailscale = deep dive when needed (logs, sessions, debugging)

### Files Created

- `PROJECTS.md` — Master Foundation tracker (4 phases, 20+ tasks)
- `.github-setup.sh` — GitHub repo + issue setup automation
- `.tailscale-setup.sh` — Tailscale remote access enablement
- `.setup-daily-summary.sh` — Daily cron job creation

### Next Actions (When Igor Returns)

1. Run `.github-setup.sh` → GitHub tracking live
2. Run `.tailscale-setup.sh` → Remote Web UI access
3. Run `.setup-daily-summary.sh` → Daily 8 PM updates

### Lessons Learned

- Workspace-native tracking beats external tools for speed
- Multi-surface monitoring = flexibility (Telegram quick glance, GitHub detailed view, Web UI deep dive)
- Setup scripts > manual instructions (one command vs. 10 steps)

### Git Commits

- `f879dae` — Telegram status notification rules
- `1e7e0ba` — GitHub issue tracking setup + sync rules
- `ae59a7a` — Tailscale + GitHub setup scripts
- `921651f` — Daily progress summary cron setup
