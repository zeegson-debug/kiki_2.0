## 02:03 - GO Signal Received

Igor: "GO"

**Clarification on timeline:**
- PROJECTS.md showed 4-week timeline (human planning habit)
- Reality: AI execution = ASAP, all 4 phases tonight
- No deadlines in weeks unless explicitly ongoing work
- Fastest, most efficient execution is the default

**Starting Foundation execution now:**
- Phase 1: Foundation Hardening (session init, Ollama, model routing, compression, token audit)
- Phase 2: Agent Factory (SOUL templates, model docs, bindings wizard)
- Phase 3: Sub-Agent Orchestration (task templates, cost reporting, auto-archive)
- Phase 4: Monitoring (dashboard, daily audit cron, cost alerts)

**Execution mode:** Straight through, Telegram + GitHub updates at checkpoints.
