## 02:03 - GO Signal Received

Igor: "GO"

**Clarification on timeline:**
- PROJECTS.md showed 4-week timeline (human planning habit)
- Reality: AI execution = ASAP, all 4 phases tonight
- No deadlines in weeks unless explicitly ongoing work
- Fastest, most efficient execution is the default

**Starting Foundation execution now:**
- Phase 1: Foundation Hardening (session init, Ollama, model routing, compression, token audit)
- Phase 2: Agent Factory (SOUL templates, model docs, bindings wizard)
- Phase 3: Sub-Agent Orchestration (task templates, cost reporting, auto-archive)
- Phase 4: Monitoring (dashboard, daily audit cron, cost alerts)

**Execution mode:** Straight through, Telegram + GitHub updates at checkpoints.

## 02:04 - Phase 1 Start: Foundation Hardening


### Phase 1.1 - Session Init Rule ✅
- Added token efficiency section to AGENTS.md
- Context discipline: Only read needed files, no repeated reads, compress workspace files
- Model routing: Haiku → Sonnet → Opus
- Target: 10-20kb per prompt

### Phase 1.2 - Ollama Install ✅
- llama3.2:3b pulled and verified
- Ollama server running on localhost:11434

### Phase 1.3 - Model Routing ✅
- Set Haiku (anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5) as primary
- Fallbacks: Sonnet → Opus
- Heartbeat model: ollama/llama3.2:3b (free local inference)
- OLLAMA_API_KEY exported
