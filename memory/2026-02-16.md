## Foundation Planning Session

**Time:** 01:00–01:15 CST  
**Participants:** Igor + Kiki

### What Happened

Igor initiated **Foundation** (Task #1): OpenClaw Lean Operation Setup. Goal = 97% cost reduction via token discipline.

### Key Decisions

1. **Tracking:** Workspace-native (`PROJECTS.md`), NOT Notion
   - Reason: Speed, zero external deps, git-backed, native OpenClaw access
   
2. **4-Phase Rollout:**
   - Phase 1: Foundation Hardening (this week) → 80% cost cut
   - Phase 2: Agent Factory (next week) → SOUL templates + bindings wizard
   - Phase 3: Sub-Agent Orchestration (week 3) → workflow templates
   - Phase 4: Monitoring (week 4) → dashboard + alerts

3. **Phase 1 Priorities (THIS WEEK):**
   - Session init rule → `AGENTS.md`
   - Install Ollama → route heartbeats to local LLM
   - Model routing → Haiku primary, fallbacks to Sonnet/Opus
   - Compress workspace files → trim bloat
   - Token audit setup → 3x calibration cycle

### Research Completed

- Reviewed OpenClaw docs: multi-agent routing, system prompt, sub-agents, agent workspace
- Analyzed 2 YouTube videos on 97% cost reduction strategies (Matt Ganzac)
- Key insights:
  - Context bloat = #1 cost driver (full session history + workspace files on every turn)
  - Ollama heartbeats = zero idle burn
  - Model routing (Haiku → Sonnet → Opus) = 95% task savings
  - Session init rule = 80% context overhead reduction

### Next Steps

1. **Igor:** Review `PROJECTS.md` tracker
2. **Kiki:** Start Phase 1.1 (Session Init Rule) on Igor's signal
3. **Kiki:** Update `memory/2026-02-16.md` at EOD with progress

### Blockers

None yet.

### Notes

- Igor's vibe: Fast, decisive, zero-waste. Matches perfectly with Foundation objectives.
- Tracking system designed for speed — no external tools, all workspace-native.
- Expected Phase 1 completion: <1 hour of work.
